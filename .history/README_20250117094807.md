This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
## Approach
In this project, I focused on building a responsive UI/UX design based on the given Figma template. The design is implemented using Next.js for seamless server-side rendering and efficient performance, while Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling and responsiveness across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop, etc.).

## The development process included:

## Figma Template Reference: 
The project closely follows a Figma template to ensure pixel-perfect design alignment.[Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/zcuvkUTQoPsYnyvLvOL49Q/Ecommerce-Desktop-Website.-(Community)?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=vvGns87aUxs9Nd6J-0)
## Responsive Design: 
Special care was taken to make the design fully responsive on all devices, ensuring smooth user experiences across various platforms.
## Next.js: 
Used as the primary framework for building the project. Next.js ensures optimal performance with features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
## Tailwind CSS: 
Tailwind was chosen to rapidly build and style components using utility classes, which improved development speed and allowed for easy customization.

## Depoly
The project is deployed on Vercel for continuous integration and automatic deployment from GitHub.
